## Kobe - A Homage for my best buddy
...my doge

### Overview

Meet Kobe.

Kobe is a 3D animated and interactive graphic that will be named and modeled after my dog. This application will be completed within a 5-day deadline and will feature Vanilla JavaScript. Kobe is a Mini white american eskimo.

  * This application will be interactive in a sense that the user will be able to pet Kobe, feed him his favorite treat (A piece of juicy watermelon), and use a toy to play with him.

    * I will begin by trying to render his face and his mane and If I far enough, next will be his body!
    * For the interactive elements, I will start with the petting, second; the treat, and lastly the toy.


### Interactivity and Functionality

When visiting Kobe, users will be able to:

  * Visit Kobe and say Hi :) (landing page, various facial expressions)
  * Pet Kobe and watch as he enjoys being pet.
  * Feed Kobe a piece of his favorite treat.
  * Wave a toy and play with Kobe.

Other features of this application will include:

  * Links to my Github, LinkedIn, AngelList, and a Flickr account that contains pictures of my doge. (jk) (actually maybe)
  * Directions on how to interact with Kobe.
  * Background music.
  * Information about how this graphic is being rendered.


### Technologies

This application will focus on and mainly utilize Vanilla `JavaScript` and feature the capabilities of the technology. In addition:

  * `three.js` for 3D Graphics.
  * `HTML5 Canvas` for DOM manipulation/Rendering.
  * `Webpack` for bundling.


### Wireframe

Kobe will consist of a single landing page. The layout will be pretty simplistic with a white background, Kobe rendered in the middle largely displayed, and the various ways to interact with him at each corner of the page.

The links to my various pages will be displayed _+______ and the details/information about how the graphic is being rendered contained in the modal _=_______

### Timeline

**Weekend**

- [ ] Read through three.js introduction documentation.
- [ ] Watch various tutorial Videos about three.js.
- [ ] Setup `three.js`.

**Day-1**: Setup all necessary files needed to start the application. Get Started on using the `three.js` environment and becoming familiar with how to start the rendering.

  - [ ] Learn more/become more familiar with `three.js`.
  - [ ] Start rendering the backdrop.
  - [ ] Start modeling of how the main graphic will look like.

**Day-2**: Learn more about the mathematics that will be needed to start the complicated rendering process of the head of Kobe. He has a double coat and mane so it'll be tough figuring out how to render all that hair.

  - [ ] Dive head on into the math that will be needed for the head and fur.
  - [ ] Get a handle of how all the rendering will work.
  - [ ] Ideally Start the rendering of the parts that don't need the fur.

**Day-3**: Start writing logic for how the user will interact with Kobe and how Kobe will react when those actions are invoked.

  - [ ] Write out all the logic for the interactivity of the application, bit by bit, starting with the petting.
  - [ ] Figure out how the model will react when the actions are invoked.
  - [ ] Render the hair and the mane.

**Day-4**: Refining the interactivity of the application and the graphic model.

  - [ ] FINISH any of the interactivity that is still in-progress.
  - [ ] Touch up on the model and make sure everything is working smoothly.

**Day-5**: Final styling and addition of the personal plugs//details and information about how the application was made.

  - [ ] Add personal plugs.
  - [ ] Add details/information about how the application was made.
  - [ ] Finishing touches to styling on the landing page and model.
